#  Hi!
My full name is **Sime On Lore**, but **Simon** will be good enough. I go by he/his/him if that's helpful.
I am a currently a student in [OSU](https://www.osu.edu) and I like this school a lot so far. Next year though, I am moving on to [GIT](https://www.gatech.edu/), a better place for me. I am guaranteed to be admitted because of the program I am in.
The only thing I need to be careful with is my GPA, which I have been paying extreme attention to. I got straight As and A+s in all my major cources so far. Here is a picture if you want to take a glimpse:
